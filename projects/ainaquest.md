---

## Project Overview
The project team comprised four developers working for the new startup company, [‘ĀinaQuest](https://ainaquest.com/). Their vision for the first development team was to design a proof of concept that allows users to identify plants and collect a database. 

## Technologies Used
The technologies used to design the mobile app included React Native, Expo Go, Plant.org, Github, Digital Ocean, and Nativebase. 

## Features Developed
The app features a proof of concept of an app that users are about to take a snapshot of a plant and identify the name of the plant. My contributions included being the UI/UX designer for some of the pages and creating presentations, as well as the poster used to showcase our work. 

## Next Steps
Further development with new development teams will incorporate ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi and Native Hawaiian plant identification.
